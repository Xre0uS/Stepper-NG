# Stepper-NG

A Burp Suite extension for chaining multi-step HTTP request sequences with automatic variable extraction, session management, and conditional logic. Define a login flow once, extract tokens with regex, and let Stepper-NG replay it transparently whenever Scanner, Intruder, or Repeater needs a fresh session.

Examples & writeup: https://xreous.io/posts/stepper-ng/

> Based on [Stepper](https://github.com/CoreyD97/Stepper) by CoreyD97. Migrated to the Burp Montoya API and extended with new features.

## Usage

### Quick Start
1. Create a sequence - click `+`, double-click the tab to rename it.
2. Add steps - click the `+` tab or right-click any request in Burp → Add to Stepper sequence.
3. Extract variables - define a regex in the post-execution variable table (e.g., `"token":"(.*?)"` with identifier `jwt`). You can also highlight text in a response and click Auto Regex.
4. Use variables - insert `$VAR:jwt$` in later steps. It gets replaced at execution time.
5. Click Execute to run all steps in order.

### Automatic Session Handling
Stepper-NG can replace Burp's session handling rules + macros.

1. Publish a variable - check the Published checkbox on a post-execution variable (e.g., `jwt` in `login-seq`).
2. Reference it - use `$VAR:login-seq:jwt$` in Repeater, Intruder, or Scanner. Stepper-NG auto-executes the sequence when it detects the reference.
3. Validation step - select one at the bottom of the sequence panel. If the condition fires (e.g., got 200), the session is valid and the rest is skipped. Otherwise, the full sequence runs.
4. Throttle - set Validate every N requests in Preferences to reduce checks during scans.

### Variable Syntax

| Type | Syntax | Scope |
|------|--------|-------|
| Step variable | `$VAR:name$` | Within the same sequence |
| Cross-sequence | `$VAR:SequenceName:name$` | From other sequences or Burp tools |
| Static global | `$GVAR:name$` | All tools, set manually |
| Dynamic global | `$DVAR:name$` | All tools, auto-extracted from responses |

## Features

### Published Variables
- Auto-trigger - when an outgoing request contains `$VAR:seq:name$` referencing a published variable, the owning sequence auto-executes first.
- Passthrough sync - published variables capture matching values from any HTTP response flowing through Burp. If a token refreshes through normal browsing, the variable updates without re-running the sequence.

### Conditional Steps
Each step can have a condition evaluated after execution:

> If status line matches `200` → then skip remaining steps. Else → continue.

Condition types: Status line / Response body (match or not-match regex), or Always (unconditional).
- Then - fires when the condition is true. Actions: continue, skip remaining steps, or go to a named step.
- Else - fires when false. Same actions. Hidden for Always conditions.
- Retry - re-execute up to N× with a delay. If a retry flips the condition, remaining retries are skipped and the Else action fires.

| Condition | Retry | Then | Else | Use case |
|-----------|-------|------|------|----------|
| Status matches `200` | - | Skip remaining | Continue | 200 = valid session, skip rest |
| Status doesn't match `200` | 1× 500ms | Continue | Go to (fetch-csrf) | Retry once, still failing → full login |
| Response matches `"error"` | - | Go to (login) | Continue | Error → jump to login |
| Always | - | Skip remaining | *(hidden)* | Unconditionally stop |

### Session Validation
Set a Validation Step on a sequence (dropdown at the bottom). It runs first when the sequence is triggered. If its condition fires, the session is valid and remaining steps are skipped. Otherwise, the full sequence runs.

### Post-Validation
Set a Post-Validation Step to verify the session was actually recovered. After the main sequence completes, the post-validation step executes:
- Condition triggers - session recovered, failure counter resets.
- Condition doesn't trigger - failure counter increments.

After consecutive failures (default 3), Stepper-NG pauses the task execution engine and shows an alert (configurable in Preferences).

### Concurrent Request Handling
Burp uses multiple worker threads (scanner, intruder). When a sequence is already executing (e.g., refreshing a token), other worker threads arriving with `$VAR:` references would normally read stale variable values.

Enable "Hold requests while sequence is executing" in Preferences → Session Handling to make concurrent threads wait until the sequence finishes, so they receive freshly updated values. Threads wait up to 30 seconds before timing out.

### Global Variables
- Static (`$GVAR:name$`) - manual key-value pairs in the Global Variables tab. Useful for credentials, hostnames, or constants.
- Dynamic (`$DVAR:name$`) - define a regex + optional host filter. Values auto-update from all HTTP responses. Enable "Also capture from requests" for client-side generated values (e.g., JS-computed tokens). Inspired by [burp_variables](https://github.com/0xceba/burp_variables).

### Shared Variable Names
When multiple steps extract the same value (e.g., a JWT) from different endpoints, give them the same identifier. The value syncs across same-named variables after either step executes. Only one needs to be published.

### Auto-Backup
Stepper-NG can periodically back up all sequences, variables, and settings to JSON files. This protects against data loss from Burp project file corruption.

Backup files use the same JSON format as manual Export, so they can be restored via Import. A final backup is automatically performed when the extension is unloaded.

### Other Features
- Auto-regex generation from highlighted response text
- Stepper Replacements tab - previews all variable replacements with highlighting
- Sequence Overview tab - summary of all steps with conditions, variables (✦ = published), and last result
- Sequence arguments via `X-Stepper-Execute-Before: seq: var=val` or `X-Stepper-Argument: var=val` headers
- Disable/enable individual steps or entire sequences via right-click
- Import/export sequences as JSON
- Infinite loop prevention with max nesting depth
- Corrupted project file resilience - falls back to in-memory storage if Burp's persistence layer is broken

### Session Handling Action
Stepper-NG registers a session handling action called "Stepper-NG: Variable Replacement for Extensions". This is required when the session handling rule scope includes Extensions.

Burp's processing order differs by scope:

| Scope | Order |
|-------|-------|
| Built-in tools (Repeater, Scanner, …) | Request → session handling rules replace cookie with `$VAR:` reference → Stepper HTTP handler replaces with actual value → send |
| Extensions | Extension sends request with actual value → session handling rules overwrite it with `$VAR:` reference → send (broken) |

For Extensions, the HTTP handler has already run by the time the session handling rule injects the reference. The correct value gets overwritten with a literal `$VAR:` string - this breaks other extensions' requests and Stepper's own step execution.

The Session Handling Action resolves this by performing variable replacement inside the session handling phase, after the preceding rule action has injected the reference.

Setup:
1. Burp → Settings → Sessions → Session handling rules.
2. Add/edit a rule, add the action "Invoke a Burp extension action" → "Stepper-NG: Variable Replacement for Extensions".
3. Place it after any actions that inject `$VAR:`, `$DVAR:`, or `$GVAR:` references.
4. Scope the rule to include Extensions.

## Limitations

These limitations are caused by Burp Suite's architecture.

### Session Handling Rules and Extensions Scope
When a session handling rule includes Extensions in its scope, Burp applies the rule after extension HTTP handlers have already run. If the rule replaces a cookie or header with a `$VAR:` reference, it overwrites the value that Stepper already placed there. The reference is sent as a literal string.

This affects other extensions (ActiveScan++, Turbo Intruder, etc.) and Stepper-NG's own step execution.

Workaround: add the "Stepper-NG: Variable Replacement for Extensions" session handling action as the next action after the one that injects references, scoped to Extensions.

If the extension sends requests with no variable references (literal stale tokens), Stepper-NG has no way to know which values to update.

2. Burp Suite → Extensions → Add → select `stepper-ng.jar`

## Concurrency

Stepper-NG is designed for Burp's concurrent workloads (scanner, intruder, proxy firing simultaneously):

- One-at-a-time execution - each sequence holds a `synchronized` lock. Concurrent callers arriving while a sequence runs are silently skipped (or held if **Hold requests** is enabled).
- Hold requests mode - when enabled, concurrent worker threads wait for the executing sequence to finish (up to 30s) so they receive freshly updated variable values instead of stale ones.
- Thread-local execution stack - prevents circular dependencies and enforces a maximum nesting depth of 10.
- Internal request tagging - step execution requests are tagged per-thread so the HTTP handler skips them.
- Volatile flags - `isExecuting` and `disabled` use `volatile` for lock-free pre-checks on the hot path.
- EDT safety - all Swing updates dispatch via `invokeAndWait`/`invokeLater`. Post-validation alerts show outside the synchronized block to prevent deadlocks.
